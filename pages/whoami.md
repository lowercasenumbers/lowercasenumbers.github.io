Hey there, I am lowercasenumbers, a  cybersecurity professional and entheusiast. My journey into cybersecurity began with a healthy dose of curiosity and a drive to understand how things really work. This site is a place where I share various things that I have learned as a way the help deepen my own persoanl understanding of a topic. I also post HackTheBox and CTF machine walkthroughs. 

I hope you find something here that is worth your time.
