Hey there, I am lowercasenumbers, a  cybersecurity professional, enthusiast and council member of OSI. My journey into cybersecurity began with a healthy dose of curiosity and a drive to understand how things really work. This site is a place where I share various things that I have learned as a way the help deepen my own personal understanding of a topic. I mostly post HackTheBox and CTF machine walkthroughs but hope to expand that to other topics soon. 

I hope you find something here that is worth your time.
